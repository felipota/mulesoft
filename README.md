you will find the result of the exercise, a design document and some images that are also inside the document, you will also find the workspace where you will find an API developed in Anypoint studio, finally you will find a folder named nodeMock where I created a small service with express and node js to mock the different system APIÂ´s.

To make it work you should create a queue inside Anypoint MQ and replace the credentials and name if necessary. you should also run the service using node js and express, for this you should install either using npm or yarn these two tools, once you have all the tools inside your computer they should simply be in the service directory and type in the command line "node app.js" to start the service.
